# My BIO & Portfolio

## PURPOSE 

This webpage displays my portfolio, and it is divided into three different sections which are About Me, Work, and Contact Me. Here employers can view more indepth information about myself.


## User Story

```
AS A JOB SEEKER
I WANT to show a potential EMPLOYER a deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT the EMPLOYER can review samples of my work and assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position.
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to show a potential Employer previous work
WHEN my portfollio loads
